## Project 4 description

In this project, you will use what you learn to create your own Deep Learning model. We'll use a variety of datasets, each with different data types such as images, text, and numerical/categorical data. Your task is to choose one of these datasets and build a deep learning model upon it.

## Datasets

Choose one from the following datasets for your project:

1. **Digits Dataset**: A simplified version of MNIST containing 8x8 images of hand-written digits. [Dataset Link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_digits_last_image.html)
2. **Dogs vs. Cats Dataset from Kaggle**: A sizable dataset of 25,000 images with equal representation of dogs and cats. [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)
3. **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**: Computed features from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. [Dataset Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)
4. **Spam Text Message Classification Dataset**: A collection of labeled SMS messages, categorized as "spam" or "ham". [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
5. **German Credit Risk Dataset**: People's data categorized by various attributes to predict credit risk. [Dataset Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%29)

**In this notebook, German Credit Risk Dataset were used**
