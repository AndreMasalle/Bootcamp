## Project 2 description

In this Machine Learning Project, you will create your own supervised Machine Learning (ML) model. We will use the full FIFA21 Dataset and we will identify players that are above average.

We will use the column "Overall" with a treshold of 75 to define players that are 'Valuable'. This will become our target output which we need for a supervised ML model. Because we use the "Overall" as our target output, you cannot use "Overall" in your features, this will be explained further below.

This project will provide a comprehensive overview of your abilities in machine learning, from understanding the problem, choosing the right model, training, and optimizing it.
